Welcome to the developer tools project in the `atlas_web_development` repo for Atlas School! In this project, I'll be exploring browser development tools.

## Project Overview

This project will contain answer files and image files that answer questions for our project.
These questions will all be working on learning dev tools. From navigation to funtionality we cover all in this project.
